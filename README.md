In this assignment, you will build an app for taking simple notes. The user interface has two parts. 
The upper part contains an EditText for writing a note and a button to add that note to the current list. 
The lower part is a list of notes (designed as a ScrollView over an LinearLayout), each note is editable 
and has a button next to it to remove it from the list.
